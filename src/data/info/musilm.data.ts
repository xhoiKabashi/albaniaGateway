      title: "Historical Context",
      para: "Albania's religious landscape has been shaped by its history. The Ottoman Empire, which ruled Albania for over four centuries, introduced Islam to the region. However, during the communist era (1944-1991), Albania was declared an atheist state, and all forms of religious practice were banned. This period significantly impacted religious affiliations and practices in the country.",

This unique blend of religious influences and secularism defines Albania's cultural and social fabric, making it a model of peaceful coexistence.",
