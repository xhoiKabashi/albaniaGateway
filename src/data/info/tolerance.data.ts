      title: "Historical Background",
      para: "Albania's history has seen the influence of various religions, including Christianity and Islam. The introduction of Christianity dates back to the Roman and Byzantine periods, with significant landmarks like the early Christian basilicas testifying to its ancient presence. Islam was introduced during the Ottoman Empire's rule, starting in the late 14th century. Despite these shifts, the Albanian people have maintained a culture of religious tolerance and coexistence. The communist regime (1944-1991) declared Albania an atheist state, leading to the persecution of religious practices and institutions. However, the resilience of religious traditions and the spirit of tolerance endured, emerging strongly after the fall of communism.",
